    <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I am currently a final-year PhD candidate in Economics at Monash University, Australia, where I am also a Teaching Associate and Research Assistant at the Centre for Development Economics and Sustainability. My research interests lie in development economics, with a particular focus on nation building, economics of ethnicity, and gender.</p>

<p>My current research projects include investigating the role of information and emotional nudges in harmonizing ethnic groups and exploring the impacts of gender norms on womenâ€™s hiring and workplace experiences in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Before starting my doctoral studies, I held several academic and research positions. I served as a Lecturer and an Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Economics at the University of Colombo, Sri Lanka, where I taught and mentored undergraduate students. My research during this period focused on economic development, trade, and the socio-economic factors influencing education and employment.</p>

<p>I have been recognized with several scholarships and awards, including the Co-funded Monash Graduate Scholarship, the Monash International Tuition Scholarship, and the Fulbright Masters Scholarship.</p>

<h3 style="margin:20px 0 5px;">Nation Building Through Harmonizing Ethnic Groups: The Role of Information
and Emotional Nudges</a></h3>


<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(11)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_11"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_11" style="display:none;">: We evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative intervention designed to diminish prejudicial attitudes while fostering compassion, trust, and collaboration between two ethnic groups. To evaluate the efficacy of our intervention, we use a cluster randomized controlled trial within the Jaffna and Hambantota districts of Sri Lanka. We examine the influence of screenings of two documentary films prepared to raise awareness regarding the lifestyles, cultures, and challenges faced by both ethnic communities, with the overarching goal of reshaping prevailing ethnic norms. We exploit the information and empathy channels inherent in documentary videos, facilitating access to novel information while simultaneously eliciting empathy and emotional responses to alter norm and behavioural change. We randomly selected villages into treatment group and control group from both districts. The treatment group was exposed to a documentary focusing on ethnic harmony, while the control group watched a documentary of similar duration centred on rainforests. We also conducted surveys on untreated individuals residing in treated households in treatment villages at baseline and endline, to investigate potential spillover effects of the intervention. We carried out three incentivized lab-in-the-field experiments, encompassing the trust game, ultimatum game, and the prisoner's dilemma, involving participants from both ethnic groups, to assess the levels of trust, compassion, and collaboration. Our findings unveil substantial reductions in prejudicial attitudes within both ethnic groups toward one another. Moreover, we observed significant improvements in attitudes of compassion and collaboration. Our results remained robust, accounting for social desirability bias. The information, empathy and emotional channels emerged as the three important underlying mechanisms driving these changes in outcomes. This research underscores the imperative of fostering positive intergroup relationships within diverse and conflict-prone societies, ultimately advancing the cause of nation-building.

    Improving Gender Norms in the Workplace 
    <span style="color: blue;">(Accepted: <em>Journal of Development Economics</em> Pre-Results Review)</span>

<p style="margin:0 0 5px;"><a href="javascript:toggle(12)">Abstract<span id="pubabslink_12"> (click to expand)</span></a><span id="pubabs_12" style="display:none;">: Gender norms influence women's access to employment opportunities and their workplace experiences, which can subsequently affect firm productivity. We conduct a randomized experiment with 1,900 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to examine gender norms in the workplace and assess the impact of promoting more gender-equitable norms among both workers and firm owners. Specifically, workers and firm owners in randomly selected markets participate in an intensive, three-day gender norms training program. We measure the impact of this training on gender attitudes, women's workplace experiences, inter-employee interactions, and firm productivity using self-reports and lab-in-the-field experiments. By understanding the malleability of gender norms and their effects on workplace dynamics and productivity, this study aims to inform interventions and policies that promote more equitable norms and evaluate their broader effects on productivity.
